# How to contribute to a project :

1. Find the Project:

Locate the project's repository.

2. Fork the Repository:

On the project's repository page, click the `Fork` button. This creates a copy of the project under your GitHub account.

3. Clone Your Fork:

Use Git to clone your forked repository to your local machine:

bash/cmd
`git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git`

4. Create a New Branch:

Create a new branch for your contribution. This keeps your work separate from the main project.

`git checkout -b feature-or-fixes`

5. Make Changes:

Implement your contribution, whether it's a new feature, bug fix, or improvement.

6. Test Your Changes:

Test your changes to ensure they work as intended and do not introduce new issues.

7. Commit Your Changes:

Commit your changes to your local repository:

`git add .`
`git commit -m "Your commit message"`

8. Push to Your Fork:

Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub:

`git push origin feature-or-fix-name`

9. Create a Pull Request:

On your forked repository page, create a pull request to the original project's repository.
Describe the purpose of your changes in the pull request description.

And that's it !!
